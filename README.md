# Traffic-Law-Enforcement-System

This project was done as part of the E-yantra Ideas Competition (EYIC) conducted by e-yantra, IIT Bombay. The main aim of this project is to control the traffic signals at a junction based on the density of vechicles on each road. We have used Farneback Optical Flow to check the density on each road and have used threading to send spontaneous response to the traffic signals. We have also made a solution to find the speed of a vehicle using ultrasonic sensors.
Requirements: OS: Any Linux based OS, Python version 3.6, openCV version 2.4.9, numpy module, Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO R3, A traffic lights model using LEDs, Four test case videos representing each lane, Ultrasonic Sensors
