# Traffic Law Enforcement System #

In this project, we developed an automatic traffic light control system based on motion on the various lanes meeting at a junction. We applied multithreading of Gunnar-Farneback optical flow on the camera surveillance of four lanes meeting at a junction and compared their outputs to control the traffic lights. 
The project was presented in a simplified abstraction of a road junction with toy cars used to represent vehicles and led bulbs used to represent the traffic lights. All the logic were coded in Python except for the light controls which were programmed into an Arduino board. <br/>

This repo contains all the code related to this project.
