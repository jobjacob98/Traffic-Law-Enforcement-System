# Traffic Law Enforcement System #

In this project, we developed an automatic traffic light control system based on the traffic intensity in the individual lanes in a 4-way intersection. We applied Gunnar-Farneback optical flow on the camera surveillance of the four lanes and compared their outputs to control the traffic lights.

The project was presented as a simplified abstraction of a road intersection with toy cars used to represent vehicles and led bulbs used to represent the traffic lights. The Gunnar-Farneback optical flow algorithm was implemented in Python and the light bulbs were controlled using an Arduino. <br/>

This repo contains all the code related to this project.
